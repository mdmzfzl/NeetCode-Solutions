Problem: LeetCode 36 - Valid Sudoku

Key Idea:
To determine if a given Sudoku board is valid, we need to check three conditions:
1. Each row must have distinct digits from 1 to 9.
2. Each column must have distinct digits from 1 to 9.
3. Each 3x3 sub-grid must have distinct digits from 1 to 9.

We can use three nested loops to traverse the entire board and use sets to keep track of digits seen in each row, column, and sub-grid.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(1), as the Sudoku board is always a fixed 9x9 grid. We traverse each cell of the grid once, and the number of cells is constant.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as well because we are using a fixed amount of additional space (sets) that does not depend on the size of the input grid.
