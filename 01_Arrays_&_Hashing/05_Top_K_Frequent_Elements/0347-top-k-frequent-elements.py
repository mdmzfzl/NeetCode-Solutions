Problem: LeetCode 347 - Top K Frequent Elements

Key Idea:
To find the k most frequent elements in the given list, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to keep track of the frequency of each element. We then use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep the k most frequent elements at the top. We traverse the list once to build the frequency map, and then we traverse the map to keep the k most frequent elements in the min-heap.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n + k*log(n)), where n is the number of elements in the input list. Building the frequency map takes O(n) time, and inserting k elements into the min-heap takes O(k*log(n)) time.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the frequency map of all elements in the input list. Additionally, the min-heap will also have a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case if all elements are unique.

        for num, frequency in frequency_map.items():
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (frequency, num))
            if len(min_heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        return [num for frequency, num in min_heap]
