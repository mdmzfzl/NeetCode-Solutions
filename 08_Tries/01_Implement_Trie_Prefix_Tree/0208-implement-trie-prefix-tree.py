Problem: LeetCode 208 - Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

Key Idea:
To implement a Trie (prefix tree), we create a TrieNode class that represents each node in the trie. Each node contains a dictionary that maps characters to child nodes. We start with an empty root node and add words by traversing the characters and creating nodes as needed.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion: The time complexity of inserting a word into the trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word.
- Search: The time complexity of searching for a word in the trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word.
- StartsWith: The time complexity of checking if there is any word in the trie that starts with a given prefix is O(m), where m is the length of the prefix.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the trie and m is the average length of the words. This is due to the space required to store the trie nodes and the characters in the words.
