Problem: LeetCode 211 - Design Add and Search Words Data Structure

Key Idea:
To design a data structure that supports adding and searching words, we can use a Trie (prefix tree) with a special character '.' to represent any character. When searching, we traverse the Trie and recursively search in all child nodes for matching characters or '.'.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion: The time complexity of adding a word to the Trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word.
- Search: The time complexity of searching for a word in the Trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the Trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the Trie and m is the average length of the words. This is due to the space required to store the Trie nodes and the characters in the words.
