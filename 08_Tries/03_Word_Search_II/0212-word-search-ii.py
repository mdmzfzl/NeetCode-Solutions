Problem: LeetCode 212 - Word Search II

Key Idea:
To find all the words from a given list that can be formed by a 2D board of characters, we can use a Trie (prefix tree) to efficiently search for words while traversing the board. We start by building a Trie from the given list of words. Then, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the board, checking if the current path forms a valid prefix in the Trie. If it does, we continue the DFS until we find words or reach dead ends.

Time Complexity:
- Building Trie: The time complexity of building the Trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the list and m is the average length of the words.
- DFS: The time complexity of the DFS traversal on the board is O(n * m * 4^k), where n and m are the dimensions of the board and k is the maximum length of the words.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the Trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the list and m is the average length of the words.
- The space complexity of the DFS recursion stack is O(n * m) as well, due to the potential depth of the recursion.
