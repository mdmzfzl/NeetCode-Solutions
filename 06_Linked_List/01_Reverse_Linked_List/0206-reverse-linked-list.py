Problem: LeetCode 206 - Reverse Linked List

Key Idea:
To reverse a singly linked list, we need to reverse the direction of the pointers while traversing the list. We maintain three pointers: 'prev' (to keep track of the previous node), 'current' (to keep track of the current node), and 'next_node' (to keep track of the next node in the original list). In each iteration, we update the 'current.next' pointer to point to the 'prev' node, and then move 'prev' and 'current' pointers one step forward. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the original list, and the 'prev' pointer will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse each node once to reverse the list.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1), as no extra space is used other than a few variables to keep track of nodes and pointers.

        prev = None

            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev

            current = next_node
