Problem: LeetCode 138 - Copy List with Random Pointer

Key Idea:
To create a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers, we can follow a three-step approach. First, we duplicate each node in the original list and insert the duplicates right after their corresponding original nodes. Second, we update the random pointers of the duplicate nodes to point to the correct nodes. Finally, we split the combined list into two separate lists: the original list and the duplicated list.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list three times, once to duplicate the nodes, once to update the random pointers, and once to split the lists.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n), as we need to create a duplicate node for each original node. Additionally, we use a dictionary to map original nodes to their corresponding duplicate nodes, which takes up O(n) extra space.
