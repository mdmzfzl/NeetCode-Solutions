Problem: LeetCode 25 - Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Key Idea:
To reverse nodes in k-group, we can use a recursive approach. We traverse the linked list in groups of k nodes, reversing each group. For each group, we maintain pointers to the group's first node ('start') and the group's last node ('end'). We reverse the group in-place and connect the previous group's 'end' to the reversed group's 'start'. We then recursively reverse the remaining part of the linked list.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We process each node exactly once in groups of k nodes.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(k), as we use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and variables during the recursion.
