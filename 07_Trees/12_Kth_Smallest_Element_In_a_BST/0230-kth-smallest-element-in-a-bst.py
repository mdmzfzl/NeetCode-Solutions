Problem: LeetCode 230 - Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Key Idea:
To find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree (BST), we can perform an in-order traversal and keep track of the count of visited nodes. When the count reaches k, we've found the kth smallest element.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(h + k), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the average case, when the tree is balanced, the height is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, when the tree is skewed, the height is O(n). The additional factor of k is due to the in-order traversal.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree.
