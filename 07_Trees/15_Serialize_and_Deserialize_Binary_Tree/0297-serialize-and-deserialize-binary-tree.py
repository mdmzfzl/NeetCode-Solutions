Problem: LeetCode 297 - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Key Idea:
To serialize a binary tree, we can perform a preorder traversal and serialize the nodes into a string. When deserializing, we split the string into a list of values and reconstruct the binary tree using a recursive approach.

Time Complexity:
- Serialization: The time complexity of serializing the binary tree is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once during the traversal.
- Deserialization: The time complexity of deserializing the binary tree is also O(n), as we process each value in the list exactly once.

Space Complexity:
- Serialization: The space complexity for serializing is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the space required to store the serialized string.
- Deserialization: The space complexity for deserializing is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the space required for the recursion stack during deserialization.
