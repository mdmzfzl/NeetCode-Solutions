Problem: LeetCode 226 - Invert Binary Tree

Key Idea:
To invert a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. For each node, we swap its left and right subtrees, and then recursively invert the left and right subtrees.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once to perform the inversion.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None

        # Swap left and right subtrees
        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

        # Recursively invert left and right subtrees
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        return root
